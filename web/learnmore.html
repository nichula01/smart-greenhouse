            <p>
                Strawberries thrive in controlled environments where physical parameters are monitored and maintained within specific ranges. Here’s how each parameter affects crop health:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Temperature:</strong> Optimal temperatures between 18°C and 25°C ensure proper growth and prevent heat stress. Excessive heat can reduce flowering and fruit size, while cold can inhibit growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Humidity:</strong> Maintaining humidity between 60% and 80% prevents fungal diseases and promotes healthy transpiration. Low humidity can lead to water stress.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Soil Moisture:</strong> Well-irrigated soil ensures nutrient uptake. Drought-like conditions can stunt growth, while overwatering leads to root rot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Light:</strong> Adequate light (12-16 hours daily) drives photosynthesis and flowering. Insufficient light delays fruiting, while excessive light can cause sunburn.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Greenhouses offer a controlled environment, protecting crops from unpredictable weather and pests. By integrating monitoring systems, farmers can automate processes such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature regulation with fans and heaters</li>
                <li>Automatic irrigation systems for consistent soil moisture</li>
                <li>Adjustable lighting for optimal growth</li>
                <li>Humidity control to minimize disease risk</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <img src="img/learnt.jpeg" alt="Smart Farming Technology" class="section-image">
            <p>
                Advanced technology like IoT sensors and AI-based predictions ensures real-time monitoring and decision-making. These systems analyze data and take corrective actions, ensuring optimal growing conditions for your strawberries.
